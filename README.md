### Steps on how to set up the project

> It is recommended to put the plugin repository in your Steam plugins folder or make some symbolic links to the
> repository for easier development.

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/tddebart/AugmentedSteam-Extension-Plugin.git`
2. Pull the AugmentedSteam submodule using `git submodule update --init`
3. Run `bun install` or use your favorite package manager
4. Run `bun build-augmented-steam` to build the AugmentedSteam submodule
5. Now you can run `bun watch` or `bun dev` to build the plugin and watch for changes

> Note: `bun dev` will only watch for changes in the webkit and frontend folder and just require a `F5` in the steam
> client to reload.
> For changes to the backend, you will need to fully restart the Steam client.
